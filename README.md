# LLM-HANOI
Debunking Apple stupid claim that LLM Cant solve hanoi tower puzzle. (Not that anyone needed me to, but i just wanted to hate on a Linkedin Post)

### Video demo:
https://www.loom.com/share/f72ebde9669c449c82e5023a65b42fd0?sid=b06ac4b8-b765-4365-a94f-b78d5e0b7097

### Run this to run the Flask APP with UI...
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py

### Run this to run the algorithm on the CLI:
   python hanoi_solver.py

### Model Utilized: Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking. (Altho I think Chat gpt 3.5 would have had simmilar results....
### Prompt:
Please create for me a python script that can win the Hanoi tower game in the most efficient amount of moves. Create a function that receives the amount of discs we want to add. And add a flask UI so we can input the amount of discs, see each move it does and a counter.
and at the end show the amount of moves it needed to do!


PS. Apple cannot make a working assistant. Not even after selling phones by saying they were to "enhance it with AI". Siri works worst than before, and its been 8 months and no clue of the Siri with context... So, I dont like them :D... Evil tim cook
